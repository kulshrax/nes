This directory contains a 6502 CPU test suite written by Klaus Dormann, obtained
from this GitHub repo: https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests

The repo includes the test suite source code (in 6502 assembly) as well as 
some prebuilt test binaries and a copy of the a56 assembler required to build
new binaries. The source files include comments explaining how to configure, 
build, and run the tests. Configuring the tests (e.g., to disable decimal mode)
requires editing and rebuilding them.

The 6502_functional_test_padded.bin test binary included in this repo was built
with decimal mode disabled using the command in build.sh. The resulting binary
produced by the assembler was missing some padding bytes (its unclear why this
happened), so the included pad_front.sh scripts adds the appropriate padding to 
get the binary to run.
